# Minibots PHP class

This PHP class is a growing collection (I've started in 2010) of small spiders and web bots that go out on the web and make some small useful jobs.
This software could help to build spiders with PHP or easily bring new functionalities to your works.

For a few years it was sold on Codecanyon, than it became difficult for me to mantain, so I've turned it offline.
Now I decide to make it open source and I've put it on Github.

When you use bot to crawl data always remember to be fair.
